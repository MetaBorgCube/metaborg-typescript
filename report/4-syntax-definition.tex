\section{Syntax definition}
The syntax definition of Typescript is defined in the TypeScript Language Specification\footnote{https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md}.
Eventhough this specification is not up-to-date for TypeScript 2, the syntax has not significantly changed between TypeScript 1 and 2.
The specification builds upon the ECMAScriptÂ® 2015 Language Specification\footnote{http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/}, as TypeScript is primarily a superset of ECMAScript.
While it is defined as a superset with additions to the syntax definitions, several productions in the TypeScript grammar modify/replace the productions with the same name in the ECMAScript definition.

% The translation of the syntax definition into the SDF3\citep{Vollebregt:2012:DST:2427048.2427056} productions started
